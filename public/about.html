<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ryan Williams. I have been a chef for 8 years and wokring in many amazing places but i've always had an itch to learn coading as it has always fascinated me. I learnt a bit during doing game developement mainly using python to code and Maya 3D to model. </p>

<p>
  I recently found a way I can learn to code using Udemy in my spare time which is what has lead me to making this portfolio. During the course so far I have learnt alot and I am starting to see the endless posibilities of web developement.
</p>

<p>I am hoping that finishing this Udemy course leaves me even more fascinated and wanting to learn even more as i hope to chnage my career and job in on making the internet an even more exciting and expressive world.</p>
